# PHPQA Testing

This repository is part of the workshop [QA for PHP projects] and offers the examples you need to follow along with the section about testing.

## To get started

In order to participate in the exercises and examples, please make sure you have cloned this repository to your local workstation before participating in the workshop.

    git clone https://github.com/in2it/phpqa-testing.git

Because we have a dependency for [PHPUnit], you also need to load these dependencies in using [Composer].

If you haven't downloaded composer yet, please install it.

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Install the dependency projects

    php composer.phar install

You're all set.
